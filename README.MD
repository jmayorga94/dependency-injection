# Dependency Injection in .NET Core - Readme

## Introduction

Dependency Injection (DI) is a powerful design pattern that enhances the development of loosely coupled code, providing flexibility and maintainability in software projects.

## Key Concepts

DI facilitates the implementation of two fundamental principles: **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**. In the context of .NET Core, it serves as a foundational concept within the framework.

It is highly recommended to incorporate Dependency Injection in your project for its numerous advantages.

## Core Principles

### Inversion of Control

The essence of IoC is that high-level modules should not be dependent on low-level modules; instead, both should depend on abstractions. This promotes a more flexible and scalable architecture.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Following the DIP, abstractions should not rely on implementation details; rather, it is the implementation details that should depend on abstractions. This principle fosters code that is resilient to changes and adaptable to evolving requirements.

## Addressing Problems with Dependency Injection

1. **Loose Coupling:** Promotes loosely coupled components, minimizing interdependence and making the system more modular.

2. **Logical Abstractions:** Encourages the creation of logical abstractions for components, contributing to a more intuitive and organized codebase.

3. **Unit Testing Support:** Facilitates unit testing by allowing the use of fake or mock dependencies, promoting a robust testing environment.

4. **Improved Readability:** Enhances code readability by emphasizing clear and concise dependencies, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code.

## Getting Started

To integrate Dependency Injection into your project, follow the best practices outlined above. Utilize abstractions, invert control, and adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle. This will not only improve the flexibility and maintainability of your code but also
